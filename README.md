# Gene Sequence Edit Distance Using Dynamic Programming 

This set of scripts takes a file of formatted gene sequences and outputs the minimum
'edit distance' based on a cost matrix that is included in this repository. Usage of 
dynamic programming techniques allows for the implementation of an algorithm with a 
time complexety of O(mxn) where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences.
